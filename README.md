Welcome to the "Learning Svelte by Practicals" repository! This repository serves as a practical guide for learning Svelte, a modern JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.

About Svelte
Svelte is a unique framework that compiles your code to efficient JavaScript, resulting in smaller bundle sizes and improved performance. It provides a smooth development experience by enabling me to write expressive and reactive components without the need for a runtime framework. With its simplicity and focus on simplicity, Svelte has gained popularity among web developers.
